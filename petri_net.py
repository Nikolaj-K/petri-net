"""
Modeling approach:
  * define Petri nets in terms of their transactions
  * define transactions in terms of the actions of their arcs
  * define arcs in terms with their action on their in- or outgoing place
  * define places as basic containers
  
Run with python 2 or 3, for the example coded up in in __main__, via
  python petri_net.py --firings 10 --marking 1 2 3 2
